Examining Stop and Search (Over)Policing

This is the repository for my data analysis project on Stops and Searches in London between 2021 and 2023. If you want to replicated my analysis please find the my .Rmd and .html file in this repo alongside the data I scraped from Trust for London on living standards in London boroughs. Please note that this analysis was conducted in January of 2023. Since this date, some UK Police stop and search data that was missing, and replaced with Met Police Dashboard data, may have become avaialable. Check this before running the code to avoid duplicate rows of data.
